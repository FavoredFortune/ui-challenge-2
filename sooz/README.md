UI challenge 2 (CodeFellow 301 Lab)


## Overview

This is a time-limited test case to build a form based on comps only, using HTML and CSS. 

## Requirements

- Use good HTML structure to scaffold this site, of course, using semantic elements where possible.
- If you want, use SMACSS-style modularity to organize your CSS; there are no specific requirements. Feel free to try an alternate system for organizing your CSS.
- Style the page to reflect the comp image provided as closely as possible; but, feel free to leave out the paragraph of instructions.
- You need not be concerned with responsiveness or mobile layout on this assignment.
- There are no absolute right or wrong answers... just do your best.

### Notes for next time ###
* Work on getting all buttons left aligned
* Be sure buttons are sprite images (not sure). It looks like they are, but I'm not even sure how they're changing.
* Work on styling the select box further and getting sprite images of arrows in it
